## Potential Workshop Description

Building communities is hard. Let's write a book to make it easier.

In this workshop at SCaLE, you'll learn more about The Open Source Way, a collaboratively written compendium of best practices for initiating, nurturing, growing, and maintaining groups of passionate contributors—and one that needs your contributions.

You'll impact this project simply by attending part or all of this interactive workshop and writing sprint. Comment on the book's proposed outline, learn the project's toolchain, and volunteer to contribute you hard-won best practices to the collection.

Participating is easy: Simply attend any number of our planned workshop activities—shorter (30 to 60 minutes) review and feedback sessions, and longer (1 to 4 hours) writing sprints—on Friday, March 06, in the Pasadena Convention Center {ROOM}. Bring your laptop, your ideas, and your collaborative spirit—and be ready participate in planning, reviewing, and creating content for The Open Source Way.
